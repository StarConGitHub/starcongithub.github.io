Our fork of the [Jackal](https://clenemt.github.io/jackal/) theme for Jekyll.

- Github for the theme: https://clenemt.github.io/jackal/
- Demo of the theme: https://clenemt.github.io/jackal/
- Creator: http://clenemt.com

To run this locally:
- clone this repo
- run `bundle install` (you need ruby 2.1+ I _think_)
- run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to view the website at localhost:4000

## Options
See the global template options inside `config.yml` first thing.

Jackal also supports the following Front Matter options,

for **pages**:
* title (the page title)
* subtitle (the page h1)
* desc (for a SEO description /= excerpt)

for **posts**:
* microtitle (for a page title /= title)
* desc (for a manual excerpt and SEO description)

See [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and [configuration](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) for more information.
