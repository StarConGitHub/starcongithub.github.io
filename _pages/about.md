## Inspiration for StarCon

Anna, Arshia, and Evy attended [HelloCon](http://hellocon.net) in Toronto, which followed the same format as the wonderful [!!con](http://bangbangcon.com) which Arshia and Evy later attended. They loved the lightning talk format, and they loved the diversity and excitement of the talks. They're excited to organize StarCon and bring some of their favourite elements of these two conferences to Waterloo!

## Our Name

The star in StarCon was inspired by the star (asterisk) that is the [wildcard character](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/wildcard-character) used in many programming tools. This character represents one or more other characters of any type, and our hope is that StarCon can represent many different types of people and topics in technology.

## Our Logo

Our logo was designed by the amazing and talented [Clare Ng](http://claricen.github.io)! It's a *light*bulb with a star in the middle (for StarCon) because we're a *light*ning talk conference.
