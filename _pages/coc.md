# Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct is our commitment to the community to provide a welcoming,
safe(r) space for all its participants. All speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at
StarCon are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers
will enforce this code throughout the event and social media spaces.

StarCon is dedicated to providing an oppression-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion (or lack thereof), nationality, or technology choices. We define oppression as any language or action that expresses, reinforces, upholds or sympathizes with any form of systemic social domination.

Please note that our [photography policy](/policies/#photography-policy), [no alcohol policy](/policies/#no-alcohol-policy), and [no weapons policy](/policies/#no-weapons-policy) are all expected to be followed and breaking these policies are also code of conduct violations.

## Expected Bheaviour

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable Behavior ##

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants, speakers, or sponsors in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, and social media.

**Unacceptable behaviors include:** intimidating, harassing, abusive,
discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in
our community online, at all related events, and in one-on-one communications
carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be
shared; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

**Harassment includes:** harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments
related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate
use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation
slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography
or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

The most common form of Code of Conduct incident is often microagressions, which are statements that reinforce the status quo, and may make minorities in tech feel uncomfortable, alone, or unsupported. Even a small microagression is still a Code of Conduct violation and we welcome reports of them.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior ##

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, and those
with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers
may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban
or permanent expulsion from the conference without warning (and without refund
in the case of a paid event).

## Experiencing Unacceptable Behavior ##

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please [contact us](#contact-us), with a description of the incident,
when and where it happened, and any other details you feel comfortable
disclosing.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members
engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing
unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers
will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## Scope ##

We expect all community participants (participants, organizers, sponsors, and
other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community
venues&mdash;online and in-person&mdash;as well as in all one-on-one
communications pertaining to community business.

## Processing Code of Conduct reports

When you report a Code of Conduct violation, the following will happen:

- Only the people you talk to and the incident responders (Evy and Arshia) will recieve information about the incident.
- We will ask what you would like to be done in response to the incident and will evaluate if we will follow through with that.
- Usually we will not respond in any way more than the reporter wishes (we are often happy to simply record an incident and not respond if that is what the reporter wishes). However, if we believe the incident is especially harmful (e.g. people's lives are in danger) or has done harm to a lot of people (e.g. something in a talk that affected all attendees)  we may choose to remove a person from the event or address the issue to our attendees more publicly.
- The timeframe in which we respond to erports  will vary incident to incident and we'll respond in the timeframe we believe necessary. However, we commit to responding to all incidents within two weeks of the conference.
- Incident details including date, time, and location will be recorded in a document in a Google Drive folder with link sharing turned off. Only Evy and Arshia will have access to this document - but we may add extra people if the issue feels serious and urgent, or if the reporter of the incident would like more organizers to be involved.
