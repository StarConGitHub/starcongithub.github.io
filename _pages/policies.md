All StarCon attendees, speakers, volunteers, and sponsors are asked to abide by these policies.

## Photography Policy

All StarCon attendees, volunteers, speakers, and sponsors will be provided with a badge. Three colors of badges are provided.

- Green means it is okay for photographers to take pictures of you.
- Blue means photographers should ask permission.
- Red means photos are not okay (they will not be published).

If no badge is visible, blue will be assumed. Photographers should avoid taking any pictures of anyone wearing a red badge and ask anyone wearing a blue badge. Since it is not possible to always correctly identify badges, if photos are taken of red or blue badge-wearing attendees, we will not publish identifiable photos of those attendees. Anyone in a published photograph in StarCon media can ask to be made unidentifiable in that published photograph.

## No Alcohol Policy

StarCon is an **alcohol-free** event. This means that we will not be serving alcohol during the conference, and
do not allow its consumption in our event spaces.
