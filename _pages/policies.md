All StarCon attendees, speakers, volunteers, and sponsors are required to abide by these policies.

## Photography Policy

All StarCon attendees, volunteers, speakers, and sponsors will be provided with a badge and a lanyard. Three colours of lanyards are provided.

- A **green** lanyard means that you allow photographs of you to be taken.
- A **yellow** lanyard means that photographers should ask for your permission before taking photographs of you.
- A **red** lanyard means that photographs of you should not be taken. If any are taken by accident by our event photographer, they will not be published.

If no lanyard is visible, our event photographer will ask permission before taking a photograph. Event photographers will avoid taking any photographs of anyone wearing a red lanyard and ask anyone wearing a yellow lanyard. Since it is not possible to always correctly identify lanyards, if photos are taken of red or yellow lanyard-wearing attendees, we will not publish identifiable photos of those attendees. Anyone in a published photograph in StarCon media can ask to be made unidentifiable in that published photograph.

All attendees, sponsors, organizers, volunteers, and speakers are also expected to abide by this policy.

## No Weapons Policy

No weapons will be allowed at StarCon events, community spaces, or in other spaces related to the conference. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all provincial and local laws on this matter.

## No Alcohol Policy

StarCon is an **alcohol-free** event. This means that we will not be serving alcohol during the conference, and do not allow its consumption in our event spaces.

## Social Rules

We love the Recurse Center's four [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) and encourage our attendees to follow them.
