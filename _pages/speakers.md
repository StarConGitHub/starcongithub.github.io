This is all temp because Safia hasn't given us the deets yet. Her twitter bio is: I'm building http://zarf.co  and sharing the story on a podcast at http://log.zarf.co . I write a lot, run a lot, code a lot, and dream big (a lot). She's at a conference right now. This is maybe how long her bio will be?
