## Keynotes

### Julia Evans

She's great. Here are some words from her site as a placeholder: I live in Montreal. I work at Stripe, on infrastructure. I read all my email and try to respond. I sometimes give talks. I have one main opinion about programming and it’s – understanding the underlying systems you use (the kernel, the operating system, the network layers, your database, HTTP, whatever you’re running on top of) is essential if you want to do amazing work and be able to fix hard problems. It’s served me well so far.

### Safia Abdalla

This is all temp because Safia hasn't given us the deets yet. Her twitter bio is: I'm building http://zarf.co  and sharing the story on a podcast at http://log.zarf.co . I write a lot, run a lot, code a lot, and dream big (a lot). She's at a conference right now. This is maybe how long her bio will be?
