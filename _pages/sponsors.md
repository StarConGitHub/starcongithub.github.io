[![](/assets/img/sponsors/stripe.png)](http://grnh.se/4cxbw61)

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a software platform for starting and running internet businesses. Hundreds of thousands of businesses—including Lyft, Kickstarter, Salesforce, Shopify, Facebook, Slack, and UNICEF—rely on Stripe’s software tools to accept payments, expand globally, and create new revenue streams. Stripe has been at the forefront of expanding internet commerce, powering new business models, and supporting the latest platforms, from marketplaces to mobile commerce sites.
<br/><br/>
We believe that growing the GDP of the internet is a problem rooted in code and design, not finance. Stripe is built for developers, makers, and creators. We work on solving the hard technical problems necessary to build global economic infrastructure—from designing highly reliable systems to developing advanced machine learning algorithms to prevent fraud. Join us!

[Square](https://squareup.com/) empowers business owners to accept payments, help restaurants set up a delivery option, and provide capital to allow businesses to grow. We make the tough choice to give people access to their funds faster.  We built the Cash App to provide a quick and easy solution to participate in the economy. To level the playing field. To make the system more fair. That's how we started and that's why we're here.
<br/><br/>
One of the greatest issues facing our civilization is economic inequality, and we have a role in addressing it. We believe everyone should be able to participate and thrive in the economy. So we build accessible tools that shorten the distance between having an idea and making a living from it. Tools that make people feel good and inspire them to do good.

FunnelCake identifies gaps between your pipeline and your growth goals, then guides Marketing, Sales, and Customer Success with actionable insights – like how many leads you need to create, when you need to hire Sales reps to hit growth targets, and red flag alerts on pipeline.

![](/assets/img/sponsors/zenreach.png)

[Zenreach](https://www.zenreach.com/) was created to solve one of the most important problems in the modern economy—the majority of our time is being spent online, yet over 93% of purchasing still happens offline — and there is no link between the two systems. Brick-and-mortar merchants are working decades behind their online counterparts without essential data and tools. We created Zenreach to give them the same level of technology and transparency that anyone operating online has come to expect.

![](/assets/img/sponsors/shopify.png)

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is a leading cloud-based, multichannel commerce platform designed for small and medium-sized businesses. Merchants can use the software to design, set up, and manage their stores across multiple sales channels, including web, mobile, social media, marketplaces, brick-and-mortar locations, and pop-up shops. The Shopify platform was engineered for reliability and scale.
