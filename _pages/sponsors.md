[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a software platform for starting and running internet businesses. Hundreds of thousands of businesses—including Lyft, Kickstarter, Salesforce, Shopify, Facebook, Slack, and UNICEF—rely on Stripe’s software tools to accept payments, expand globally, and create new revenue streams. Stripe has been at the forefront of expanding internet commerce, powering new business models, and supporting the latest platforms, from marketplaces to mobile commerce sites.

We believe that growing the GDP of the internet is a problem rooted in code and design, not finance. Stripe is built for developers, makers, and creators. We work on solving the hard technical problems necessary to build global economic infrastructure—from designing highly reliable systems to developing advanced machine learning algorithms to prevent fraud. Join us!

The [Mathematics Endowment Fund](https://uwaterloo.ca/math-endowment-fund/about) (MEF) is an income-generating fund that finances projects for the academic betterment of mathematics undergraduate students at the University of Waterloo. Members of the StarCon organizing committee have used MEF funding for previous projects on the Women in CS committee and for attending conferences. We're very grateful for their support. If you are a Waterloo math student and not in town for StarCon, we recommend reaching out to them for travel funding!

## Why You Should Sponsor Us

By sponsoring StarCon, you will empower diverse perspectives in technology and contribute towards creating a community grounded in learning. You will also have the opportunity to actively interact with a group of people keenly interested in technology. You can leverage this opportunity to market your brand and product, create awareness of your core values and philosophies, share what it’s like to be a part of your organization, talk about your plans for the future, and recruit candidates for open positions.

In addition to this, you will be supporting our mission of providing people with a community in which they can share their excitement and ideas with others. You will help us meet our goals to keep this event affordable, encourage students to speak and attend, provide an accessible venue, make sure our attendees are well fed, and give them some swag to remember us by!
