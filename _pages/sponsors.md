The [Mathematics Endowment Fund](https://uwaterloo.ca/math-endowment-fund/about) (MEF) is an income-generating fund that finances projects for the academic betterment of mathematics undergraduate students at the University of Waterloo. Members of the StarCon organizing committee have used MEF funding for previous projects on the Women in CS committee and for attending conferences. We're very grateful for their support. If you are a Waterloo math student and not in town for StarCon, we recommend reaching out to them for travel funding!

Founded late in the 20th century (1997), the Kitchener Waterloo Software Quality Association is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit, independent organization of software professionals who have an interest in quality and testing. We offer events that enable professional networking, skills development, and learning related to software quality, software testing, technical leadership, and agile development practices.
