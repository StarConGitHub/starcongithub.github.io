We're currently looking for sponsors!

## Why You Should Sponsor Us

We decided to organize StarCon because we want to invite people excited about
the work they do to share that excitement with others&mdash;because geniune
enthusiasm is inspiring! We want to organize an event in which anyone interested
about technology, regardless of their experience level, feels motivated to
pursue that interest. We want to keep this event free, encourage students to
speak and attend, provide an accessible venue, make sure our attendees are well
fed, and give them some swag to remember us by!

If you're interested in sponsoring us, or have any questions about sponsorship,
email us!
