### Notworking with a Whale: A Tale of Dockers, Networks, and Problem Solving

[Fatema Boxwala](/speakers#fatema-boxwala)

<p class="abstract">
Docker has become an extremely popular tool in the tech industry. Docker containers can be found playing a hugely important role in the infrastructure of companies from the tiniest startup to the giantest of the giants. Despite it's ubiquity, much of the inner-workings of Docker remain shrouded in mystery for developers, even for some people that work with the application regularly.  And a lot of the times, the only way to figure out what's going on is by experimenting and testing yourself. One particularly confusing aspect of Docker, and linux containers in general, is how exactly the networking inside the container works. In my talk: Notworking with a Whale: A Tale of Dockers, Networks, and Problem Solving, I will be giving a short but practical introduction to networking inside Docker and linux containers. The audience will first be introduced to the idea of network namespaces inside linux systems, and how these apply to containers and Docker. They will then be exposed to tools that can be used to interact with and troubleshoot networking issues inside a container. I will introduce these tools by sharing my own, very frustrating, experience with networking and Docker, in a problem-strategy-solution narrative. My talk will present information that will teach listeners information about linux containers, and offer some personal strategies and tools that have worked well for me.

### Gloom, Doom, and the Internet

[Keefer Rourke](/speakers#keefer-rourke)

<p class="abstract">
Since the advent of the internet, technology has undergone a revolution like no other. It has enabled connectivity on a scale that has never been seen before, enabling free distribution of information, ideas, and independent content. However, in recent years we've seen a turn of events. What was once primarily a mechanism for free expression has given way to multitudes of surveillance machines designed to track your every move. In my talk ""Gloom, Doom, and the Internet,"" I will discuss some of the privacy and security issues with technology today, and explain how you can defend the users of your Next Big Thing(tm). Attendees will be encouraged to rethink how they view internet-enabled technology, with a focus on the importance of privacy, accessibility, and security oriented designs from day one, and they will be shown how new platforms can be made successful simply by respecting their users.

### Why I Prefer Good Testing Over Excellent Testing

[Tina Fletcher](/speakers#tina-fletcher)

<p class="abstract">
I often used to feel that if we only had more time for testing, we’d find all the bugs and everything would be awesome. But the longer I’ve been working on software projects, the more times I’ve seen that this might not be true. Most of the escaped defects in my recent memory were hiding in the areas I didn’t even know to ask about, in the small differences between our test and production environments, and in the things we depend on but don’t have full control over. So lately, while I will always value doing good testing, it doesn’t feel as useful to spend a lot of time striving for truly excellent coverage. Instead, I prefer to invest in planning for phased roll outs, and gaining confidence in our ability to quickly detect and resolve problems in production. I’d like to share a few stories about defects I missed that I wouldn’t have found with all the time in the world, and about times I have been saved by solid monitoring and roll-back strategies.

### Formal Methods for Everyone: Practical Tools for Computer-Aided Reasoning

[Murphy Berzish](/speakers#murphy-berzish)

<p class="abstract">
Do you want to write code you can be confident in, and test your programs thoroughly? Formal methods is a powerful discipline of software engineering that uses logic and automated reasoning to prove correctness of programs or find counterexamples to assertions.

In this talk, I will describe two useful open source tools that you can start using to help you write better code and find more bugs in your software. I will teach you about the Z3 theorem prover, from Microsoft Research, which can assist you in reasoning about logical formulas and finding test cases to catch bugs. Then, I will talk about the KLEE symbolic execution engine, which is an automated software testing tool that uses principles from formal methods to explore the effects that different inputs have on the flow of your program.

This talk will be very applied, with an emphasis on the practical rather than the theoretical. I want this talk, as well as these tools, to be accessible to anyone, even with no background in formal logic.

### How to make a real-time collaborative text editor in 5 easy steps!

[Rudi Chen](/speakers#rudi-chen)

<p class="abstract">
With the rise of cloud applications, more and more software is becoming collaborative. That is, multiple people can be viewing and editing the same document or information at the same time. This can lead to tricky issues figuring out what the end result should be when two users simultaneously do conflicting operations (e.g. in Google Docs, two users typing in the same place). The conflict-resolution algorithms so solve these problems are increasingly important, but selfdom mentioned in any curriculum. This talk will present a newer approach to build a collaborative text editor easier to understand than common techniques found on the Internet. The technique will be presented one small layer of complexity at the time, such that at every step, the audience can get an intuition for the nature of the solution and be easily be convinced that it works. I’ll also make sure to un-dry the technical aspects talk by using humor and analogies to kiwis and water buffalos.
