## Territorial Acknowledgement ##

StarCon would like to acknowledge that we are on the traditional territory of
the Neutral, Anishnawbe and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is
situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that
includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. It is important to remember
that the land that we are using today for this event was stolen, and that there
is lots of work to do to bring back the rights that indigenous and Native people
deserve. We make this acknowledgement as part of our efforts to be inclusive and
respectful of people from diverse backgrounds.
