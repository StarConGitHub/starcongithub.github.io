StarCon was a two-day software engineering conference held in Waterloo, Ontario with two days of lightning talks about technology, computer science, programming, and the joy of learning about them!

## StarCon 2020?

Unfortunately, we will not be running StarCon in 2020. Running a conference is an immense joy. Every time we run one, we want to get it right. This means finding the best speakers (and *paying* them), the most comfortable venue, and making sure the event is accessible to everyone. The organizing team was unable to dedicate the time and effort needed for this in 2020. We hope to run StarCon sometime in the future. Stay tuned!

## Territorial Acknowledgement ##

StarCon would like to acknowledge that we are on the traditional territory of
the Neutral, Anishnawbe and Haudenosaunee peoples. The University of Waterloo is
situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that
includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. It is important to remember
that the land that we are using today for this event was stolen, and that there
is lots of work to do to bring back the rights that indigenous and Native people
deserve. We make this acknowledgement as part of our efforts to be inclusive and
respectful of people from diverse backgrounds.
